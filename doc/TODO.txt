= Skytools ToDo list =

In angular brackets after item is assumed complexity [easy, moderate, complex],
wheter it is good to have it in 3.0, and maybe also developer name
who already is handling it.

== Required for 3.0-alpha ==

* londiste demo

== Required for 3.0-final ==

* Simple Python consumer for pgq_coop, where each subconsumer
  is separate process. [easy]

* Relaxed event processing for Python pgq modules.
  As now there are more event types and several layers
  who want to process them, it seems best to remove the
  strict .tag_done() tracking. [marko]

* londiste.ref.txt update with new commands [moderate]

* Re-introduce lost Londiste features:
  - check
  - fkeys
  - globbing
  They were lost when lot of interaction code was moved to database.
  Now we need to get them working again.
  [easy - need to port 2.1 code]

* Refresh default .ini files, add comments.
  Alternative: have defailt .ini in script docstring,
  have DBScript switch to dump it.
  [easy]

* Dead node handling / failover.  We have working switchover,
  now need to able to do it with some nodes dead.
  [complex]

* New ticker [marko, martin]:
  - logging
  - daemonizing
  - error handling
  - config file?

== Good to have changes ==

=== sql/pgq ===

* drop_queue(force) - to drop consumers [3.0, easy]

* pgq_node.is_root_event() rettype [easy, but hard to decide]

* pgq, pgqadm: show stats about event counts based on seq values in ticks. [3.0, easy]

=== python/skytools ===

* DBScript: when getting error from database, log connection name with it.
  Needs wrapper functions in psycopgwrapper to either catch exceptions and
  add more details for them or to set 'last active' connection name.
  [3.0, moderate]

* Sleeping while waiting notices from db.  It seems good to speed up
  change-provider, switchover etc commands by using LISTEN/NOTIFY
  to wake up daemons. Adding notify to db functions is easy,
  sleeping part is bit harder.  [moderate]

* New DB API command `DBScript.exec_cmd()` needs better name. [3.0, hard to decide]

=== python/pgq ===

* Expose commands for node connstr change, pgq_node.drop_node(). [easy]

* Move all consumers to pgq.next_batch_info(), pgq.get_batch_cursor() [3.0, easy]

=== python/pgq/cascade ===

* Advanced admin commands.
  - node-status
  - set-status
  - on root switch/failover check if all tables are present
  [moderate]

=== python/londiste ===

* 'Q' event type for londiste, (queue_splitter event), for event
  that needs to be inserted into queue.  Also trigger flag to
  create such event.
  - better to be done as "redirect" - allow events for a table
    to be redirected to another table or queue.
  [moderate]

* --wait/--nowait switch for execute, to wait until script is applied
  to everywhere.
  [3.0, moderate]

* Decide if/how topology change or EXECUTE needs to take account
  tables in copy. [needs decision]
  - Proceed, let the admin check out details later.
  - Wait until COPY finishes.
  - Do not allow?


=== sql/londiste ===

* plpgsql trigger for TRUNCATE and Londiste support for installing such trigger [moderate]

== Doc improvements ==

* pgq_node and londiste have moved some user interaction messages
  into database, but their loglevels need review.
  This means executing various commands and seeing if output is sensible.
  [easy?]

* Python modules need docstring review. [easy?]

* dbscript: document self.args [east]

* replace "raise Exception" with "raise UsageError" , where we just
  want to inform user and so traceback is not needed. [easy]

* Document DB-API and psycopg2 details under psycopgwrapper. [hard?]

== Low-priority ==

=== Larger things ===

* skylog: publish sample logdb schema, with some tools. [moderate]
* londiste: support creating slave from master by pg_dump / PITR. [hard]
* pgq/cascade: rename node [hard]

=== Smaller things ===

* londiste: londiste status cmd [moderate]
 - check what modules are installed
 - check if replay is running (lag?)
 - check if copy is running (lag?)
 - count of tables done, count of unsynced
 - table in the middle of copy

* We need own async conn-to-conn copy loop in Python/PythonC.
  Currently we simply pipe one copy_to() to another copy_from()
  in blocked manner with large buffer,
  but that likely halves the potential throughput. [hard]
* skytools: switch (-q) for silence for cron/init scripts.
  Dunno if we can override loggers loaded from skylog.ini.
  Simply redirecting fds 0,1,2 to /dev/null should be enough then.
  [easy]
* Londiste: when buffering queries, check their size. [easy]
* automatic "repair" - after reaching sync point, the "replay"
  must be killed/paused, then fixes can be applied. [moderate]

== Just ideas ==

* skytools: config from database
* skytools: config-less operation?
* londiste: somehow automatic sync of table structure/functions/...?
